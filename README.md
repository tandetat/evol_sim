# evol_sim

evol_sim is a simulation of evolution that uses genetic algorithm and neural network implemented from scratch to simulate the evolution of birds and display it in the browser through WebAssembly. Currently, it utilizes the Roulette Method for Selection, the Gaussian Method for Mutation, and Uniform Crossover.

Future objectives:

-> Improve the user interface, adding the changes Patryk made to his project
-> Implement other selection methods, such as the rank method
-> Implement different crossover methods
-> Possibly move to another GUI (bevy)

This project is adapted from Patryk Wychowaniec's project, shorelark, available at https://github.com/Patryk27/shorelark. 

His blog posts describing his implementation were very helpful and explain very well the project's parts: https://pwy.io/en/posts/learning-to-fly-pt1.
